CASE 0
You want to view exceptions happening in a process.
procdump -e 1 -f "xyz" -t PID (view exceptions occurring in a process)
Note that the full exception information may not be shown for non IIS Processes.

CASE 1
Automatically take a dump file when a process crashes with Stackoverflow Exception.
procdump -e 1 -f C00000FD.STACK_OVERFLOW -g -ma PID  C:\Temp\fileName.dmp
After taking the dump file, you can use NTSD, WINDBG or DebugDiag to find the call stack of the code causing the problem.

CASE 2
There is a thread in WinDBG with too many exceptions and nested exceptions. To see all the exceptions run these commands.
!threads *After loading SOS.dll, run this command to view all managed threads
~82e!pe *Find the thread that has exception and run this command to view exception
~82e!pe -nested *Find the thread that has exception and run this command to view all nested exceptions
